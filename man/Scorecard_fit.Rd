\arguments{
\item{name}{brief model name as character}

\item{description}{character description describing the model}

\item{newdata}{data.frame of independent variables. Default is to
use the binned data.}

\item{y}{target to fit the data to. Default is the y variable used
for discretization.}

\item{w}{optional weight variable}

\item{nfolds}{number of k-folds with which to select the optimal
lambda value}

\item{upper.limits}{maximum value of fitted coefficients}

\item{lower.limits}{minimimum value of fitted coefficients}

\item{alpha}{type of regularization. Default is alpha == 1 for LASSO
regression. Alpha of 0 is Ridge regression while anythin in between
is the elastic net mixture.}

\item{family}{response variable distribution. Default is "binomial".}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed on to cv.glmnet}
}
\description{
fits a regularized regressoion model using the glmnet
package.
}
\details{
the fit function first calls predict and substitutes the
weight-of-evidence for all predictor variables. It then passes this matrix
on to \link{\code{cv.glmnet}}. The coefficients of a binner model fit
are restricted to [0,3]. This ensures there are no sign flips in the
model coefficients and that the relationships observed on margin are
retained in the final model.
